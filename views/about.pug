        .about-bio

          p As a full stack developer, I have a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to create seamless, user-friendly applications from start to finish. With expertise in various programming languages, databases, and frameworks, I can tackle any development challenge thrown my way. My skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React enable me to craft stunning, responsive user interfaces, while my knowledge of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB allows me to create robust and scalable server-side systems. As a result, I can deliver high-quality, end-to-end solutions that meet and exceed client expectations.
